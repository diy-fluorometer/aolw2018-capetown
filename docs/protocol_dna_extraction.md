# Protocol for DNA extraction using QuickExtract

## Materials

* 2 Thermos containers
* QuickExtract
* 2.0ml reaction tube
* Q-tip
* Dye stock 1:99 GelGreen 10,000X
* 0.2ml PCR tube

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Prepare the water baths

1. Label the thermos containers, 65C and 98C
2. Heat water and calibrate to 65C and 98C. Close the containers.

### Step 2 - Label the reaction tubes

1. Label the 2.0ml reaction tube "QE" for QuickExtract
2. Label the 0.2ml PCR tube "MS" for measurement sample

### Step 2 - Prepare the reaction tubes

1. Transfer 0.5ml of QuickExtract into the tube labeled "QE"

### Step 3 - Take the sample

1. Thoroughly rinse out the subject’s mouth twice with water. We recommend that
subjects abstain from drinking coffee before tissue collection. Alternatively, instruct
subjects to gently brush the inside surface of both cheeks with a toothbrush
(without toothpaste) followed by a thorough rinsing of the mouth with water.
3.	 Collect tissue by rolling the Q-Tip firmly on the inside of
the cheek, approximately 20 times on each side, making certain to move the brush
over the entire cheek.
4.	 Place the swab end of the Q-tip into the tube labeled "QE" and rotate the brush a minimum of five times.
Press the brush against the side of the tube and rotate the brush while removing it
from the tube to ensure most of the liquid remains in the tube.
5.	 Screw the cap on the tube tightly and vortex mix for 10 seconds. Incubate the tube
at 65°C for 1 minute.
6.	 Vortex mix for 15 seconds.
7.	 Transfer the tube to 98°C and incubate for 2 minutes.
8.	 Vortex mix for 15 seconds.

### Step 4 - Prepare the measurement sample

1. Transfer 40ul of liquid from the tube labeled "QE" to the tube labeled "MS"
2. Transfer 10ul of dye stock 1:99 to the tube labeled "MS"
3. Incubate the tube "MS" for 30 minutes at room temperature

### Step 5 - Take the measurement

1. Measure Dye+Water control, TU1, TU5, and MS and record the measurements
