* Is loading dye detrimental to fluorescence measurements?
* Are DNA ladders really the best DNA standards for fluorescence measurements? Are there alternatives? Is there maybe a way to DIY them?
* Which combination of filters gives the best readings? (High absolute values; low signal-to-noise ratio)
* If the more expensive filters are better: how much better are they? Do they justify the cost and hassle?
* Which dye is best (GelGreen, Pico488, dsGreen)? Test with DNA ladders as well as actual samples from DNA extractions, as they might behave differently in the presence of RNA, ssDNA, single nucleotides etc. Test this side-by-side with a Qubit.
* Which dye concentration is best?
