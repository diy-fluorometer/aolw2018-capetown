## Setup: Device version, software version

## Protocol: Pico488

### Step 1: Prepare the Pico488 aqueous solution.

Thaw the content of Pico488 dye vial and dilute a needed amount of the Pico488 dye solution with a buffer (10 mM Ð¢ris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7,5 recommended). Mix and use in the course of 3 hours max.

To make 1 ml of Pico488 aqueous solution:

* 12.5 ul Pico488
* 987.5 ul TE

Background: The original protocol calls for a 200-fold dilution and then instructs the user to mix 1ml of DNA sample with 1ml of Pico488 aequeous solution. (https://de.lumiprobe.com/protocols/DNA-quantification-with-Pico488), meaning it's a 1:1 mixture. Since I want to stick with the 4:1 scheme from previous measurements - 40ul of DNA sample, 10ul of dye stock - I adjusted the instructions. 200-fold dilution means 5ul of Pico488 added to 995ul of TE. The 1:1 mixture of dye solution plus DNA sample will thus have 5ul of dye in 2ml of sample. So we need to solve for x in the equation
x / 50ul = 5ul / 2000ul.
Doing this, we get x = 0.125ul. This is the amount of dye that needs to be in the 10ul dye volume. So if we want to make 1ml of dye solution we need 12.5ul of dye ($10ul * 100 = 1000ul = 1ml$, $0.125ul * 100 = 12.5ul$).

However, 1ml is too much - we only need 100ul, and the aeqeous solution is only good for 3 hours, so let's make less, say, 200ul:

* 2.5 ul Pico488
* 197.5 ul TE

## Step 2: Prepare the DNA ladder stock

We are working with Lambda Phage DNA, 0.5g/ml. To get values that are comparable to the last measurement series, let's stay with the concentrations as much as possible. The last series started from 160ug/ml. Since the starting concentration of this ladder is higher than the one we used previously, we can add an additional data point at 320 ul.

To get the starting stock for this dilution series, mix

* 64 ul of DNA ladder (500ug/ml)
* 36 ul TE

Background: Solve for x in the equation 320ug / x = 500ug / 1000ul, gives x = 640ul. We only want to make 100ul rather than 1ml, so we need 640ul / 10 = 64ul of DNA ladder and top it up to 100ul with TE.

### Step 3: Prepare the two-fold serial dilution

Sample name | DNA conc. in ug/ml
----------- | ----------
S0          | 320
S1          | 160
S2          | 80
S3          | 40
S4          | 20
S5          | 10
S6          | 5
S7          | 2.5
S8          | 1.25
Ctrl-TE     | 0
Ctrl-Dye    | 0

Add 40ul of TE to tubes S1 through S8, and Ctrl-Dye.
Add 50ul of TE to Ctrl-TE.
Put 80ul of the ladder stock in S0.
Transfer 40ul from S0 to S1, mix by pipetting, then transfer 40ul from S1 to S2. Repeat until S8.
Discard 40ul from S8.
Add 10ul of aqeous dye solution to S0 through S8 and Ctrl-Dye.
