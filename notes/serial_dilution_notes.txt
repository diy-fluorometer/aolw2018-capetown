Materials

12 PCR tubes
DNA ladder - 50bp
DNA dye - GelGreen 10000X in water
dark box

Prepare the serial dilution:

1. Tubes labelling
Label 8 PCR tubes:
TU1 160
TU2  80
TU3  40
TU4  20
TU5  10
TU6   5
TU7   2.5
TU8   1.25
Control1: 50ul water
Control2: 40ul water + 10ul DS
Control3: Empty tube
Control4: Empty box
Label 1 tube for the dye stock: dye 1:99 water

2. Prepare the dye stock
Pipette in a tube 1ul dye and 99ul water

3. Proceed with the serial dilution
- pipette 40ul of water in 7 tubes (not in the 160ug/ul)
- pipette 80ul of DNA in he 160ug/ul tube
- transfer 40ul from the 160ug/ul to the 80ug/ul and mix by pipetting.
- Repeat this process for each dilution step, until the lowest concentration is reached
- dispose of 40 ul from the last tube.

4.
Add 10ul of dye stock to each tube

16:20: dye+dna -> 16:50

take 20 readings each
start at 17:50
