# Plan for the day

* Assemble the case
* Take photos of the assembly process
* Write assembly instructions
* First test measurements with text marker (dilution series)
* Pulsing LED from NodeMCU?
* If there is time: cut the glass filters

# What we did today

## Case assembly

The case assembly is done. We also did a photo series of all assembly steps to include in the assembly instructions. The photos still have to be edited; the raw versions are in this repo in `$REPOROOT/docs/assembly/unedited`.

## Test measurements

We did not get around to doing test measurements yet - there were some changes that needed to be made to the NodeMCU software first.

## Pulsing LED / Cellphone-only approach

TODO Robert

## Cutting glass filters

We also did not get around to that today.

## Changes to NodeMCU software

Lisa started to re-work the NodeMCU code; the code is starting to out-grow the basic Arduino sketch scope, so the re-work is mostly about modularizing it to make maintenance and collaboration easier.

* Introduce some data structures
* Pull out the HTML/UI code from the C code
* Define HTTP endpoints more cleanly
* Encapsulate and re-organize the measuring and storing of measurements
