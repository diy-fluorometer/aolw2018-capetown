# Plan for the day

* Assemble the case
* Take photos of the assembly process
* Write assembly instructions
* First test measurements with text marker (dilution series)
* Pulsing LED from NodeMCU?
* If there is time: cut the glass filters

# What we did today

## Case assembly

The case assembly is done. We also did a photo series of all assembly steps to include in the assembly instructions. The photos still have to be edited; the raw versions are in this repo in `$REPOROOT/docs/assembly/unedited`.

## Test measurements

We did not get around to doing test measurements yet - there were some changes that needed to be made to the NodeMCU software first.

## Pulsing LED / Cellphone-only approach

In order to power a LED with your phone you need to turn the usb plug of the phone into a "master" that supplies the connected device with the 5 V that usb devices run on. to do that you basically have to buy or build an usb on the go (otg) cable. there are a lot of instructables (http://www.instructables.com/howto/usb+otg+cable/)
The trick is that the micro usb in your phone has 5 pins while a standard usb has 4. 
to turn the micro usb into a "master" you have to short circiut pin 4 and pin 5 as seen in this figure.

In our case its enough to get out + and GND and i devised a simpler version where just those pins have cables and pin 4 and 5 are soldered together. As seen here.

in order to make the LED light measurable with the sound input of the phone the LED has to be pulsed with a frquency between 20 and 20kHz. To switch the LED with a desired frequency i initially wanted to use a transistor that is switched with the sound output. I currently have no transistor that is saturated at 0.5 V and i need an op amp or a low voltage switching transistor. 
To circumvent this problem for now i devised the following circiut.

This circiut makes it possible to modulate the light emmited by the LED. 

the circuit is a good example of bad engeneering and at this point I would not recomend replicating it. It runs current through the audio output. In the case of my phone it does not appear to destroy the phone immediately but i cant't promise this to be the case for other phones. However, this video shows that it works (https://photos.app.goo.gl/Z7diii5wAZOSIRTq1). The LED "flikers" really fast and the photoresistor picks up the signal which can in turn be measured with the spectrum analyser (audio) function of the physics toolbox app
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrystianvieyra.physicstoolboxsuite&hl=en_US).

To build the circiut I just took an old headphone, opened the microphone and soldered the potoresistor to the two cables that connect to the mic. I biuld two versions. One has the microphone still attached parallel to the resistor in the other i jut cut away the mic. Both versions are recognized by the cellphone. One is sensitive to sound and light and the other is solely sensitive to light.

To modulate the LED I opened the right headphone and soldered contacts to it that can be contacted to the LED (see video above).

## Cutting glass filters

We also did not get around to that today.

## Changes to NodeMCU software

Lisa started to re-work the NodeMCU code; the code is starting to out-grow the basic Arduino sketch scope, so the re-work is mostly about modularizing it to make maintenance and collaboration easier.

* Introduce some data structures
* Pull out the HTML/UI code from the C code
* Define HTTP endpoints more cleanly
* Encapsulate and re-organize the measuring and storing of measurements
