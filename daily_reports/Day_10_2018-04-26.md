# Plan for the day

We learned a lot yesterday that led us to rearrange our plan a bit. We have to following nice-to-have tasks for the last two days of the workshop:

Prio 1:
* DNA extraction & measurement of actual DNA - 4h
* Measure filters

Prio 2:
* Improve the circuit for the cellphone version
* Case use notes -> redesign - 4h
* Improve NodeMCU code version
