# Plan for the day

We learned a lot yesterday that led us to rearrange our plan a bit. We have to following nice-to-have tasks for the last two days of the workshop:

Prio 1:
* DNA extraction & measurement of actual DNA - 4h
* Measure filters

Prio 2:
* Improve the circuit for the cellphone version
* Case use notes -> redesign - 4h
* Improve NodeMCU code version


## Measurements with the Cell-phone-only approach

We prepared several samples in a first attempt we extracted DNA and stained it. 
Due to the extarction process the DNA is not solved in Water anymore but in Quick Extract (QE) solution. Our controll is thererfore QE plus the GelGreen dye. 
After the DNA exraction and the first measurements we figured that we want to do a second extraction using less QE and more DNA
The cell phone only setup was dissassembled in between the measurements. 
This is why there is a measurement of MS earlier and later. Discrpancies may have arisen from changes in the setup. However, we also noticed that there was stuff settling on the botom of the tube (see picture).

Inbetween the measurements the respective tube has been removed from the sample holder rotated around its vertical axis and put back in place. This was done to avoid a fals reading due to eventual anisotropies in the tube and to see wheter the placement of the tube has a major influence on the measurement.
