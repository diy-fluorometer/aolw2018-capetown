# Plan for the day

Go to the MakerStation fablab and cut the case

# What we did today

Going to the MakerStation, cutting, adjusting and re-cutting took up a large chunk of the day, so there's not much to write down for today.

Note: In Berlin we use lasercutting for quickly get casing done. Usually takes 10 to 20 minutes to reach a lasercutter. In Cape Town we had to take a train and basically half of the day was lost to reach a lasercutter. Thus a solution that is meant to be quick, may be unpractical in some parts of the world, and accessibility iusses may arise.
