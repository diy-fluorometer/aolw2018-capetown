## Bug in TSL2591 sensor code

The TSL2591 sensor offers four different gain settings:

| LOW    | 1x    |
| MEDIUM | 25x   |
| HIGH   | 428x  |
| MAX    | 9876x |

If there is very little light, the sensor might fail to return a value at the gain setting LOW, but a useable value at gain setting HIGH, for example. Under most conditions, the sensor returns useable values at several gain settings.
For example, when measuring with just the empty sensor box, we get the following values:

| Value | Gain level |
| -----:| ---------- |
| 14563 | MAX        |
| 631   | HIGH       |
| 37    | MED        |
| 1     | LOW        |

I thought it desirable to map the readings to a single scale, namely the one associated with the MAX gain setting. It turned out that the way I was trying to do that was wrong, hence the strange sensor readings. There's also not an easy fix, because there is no way you can map a value obtained at gain level LOW to a precise value on the MAX scale. Any value at LOW would map to entire range of values on the MAX scale.
So for today's measurements, I settled for recording the readings at all gain settings for each measurement and then sort through that data during the analysis stage.
One option would be to use the Lux calculation from the [Adafruit TSL2591 sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TSL2591_Library/blob/master/Adafruit_TSL2591.cpp). We can still do that later based on the data we have.
Note that we only record the data from the sensor's Channel 0 (IR+Visible), and ignore Channel 1 (IR).

## Measurements with DNA ladder + fluorescent dye


## Pulsing LED / Cellphone-only approach

Since the measurements with the textmarker where promissing we assembled the circuit described on day 5 withing an old fluorometer-housing. 
to measure the dilution series Roberts cell phone (Huawei P10) was connected to the "Cell-phone-only-fluorometer". To play the frequency the LED is modulatred with we used the signal generator app:(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xyz.signal). It can keep playing even if an other app is opened (see settings). 
The frequency was randomly chosen to be 479 Hz and therefore not coincide with overtones of the power grid. We used a sine since it appaered to have a slightly better signal to noise ratio.

To measure the Signal we used the FFT app: (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.intoorbit.spectrum)

The seettings where chosen as seen in the screenshot:

The dilution series was measured in total 6 times. Inbetween m1 and the rest of the measurements i dissassembled the setup and pulsed the LED with an Arduino. I thought this would improve the SNR. However it did not and instead the signal was fluctuating much more. I still have to figure out why.
I changed the setup to the initial conditions and tried to replicate the results of m1. I also took 5 values (m2-m6) to get a grasp of the fluctuations of the values.

Replicating worked well and the fluctuations are negligible.

The approach with the arduino should have given a better SNR. Indeed the max value of the peak was much higher. However it also
