What we did today

We went to the makerspace and lasercut the test case fitting the new test setup
The lasercutting proceeded smoothly, the casing was good enough to proceed and operation was successful.

Note: In Berlin we use lasercutting for quickly get casing done. Usually takes 10 to 20 minutes to reach a lasercutter.
In Cape Town we had to take a train and basically half of the day was lost to reach a lasercutter.
Thus a solution that is meant to be quick, may be unpractical in some parts of the world, and accessibility iusses may arise.
